### CPSC 120

* Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time I wrote code in C++. I was able to write “Hello Jerome!” and have it printed out in the terminal which I never had done. I took this as a huge learning opportunity and continued to seek out more knowledge about programming. The lab also benefited me since this is when I saw the benefits of pair-programming.
  
* Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it involved math for calculating the price of a pizza per square inch that was served. I liked this lab because it was the first lab that touched on using math in programming and using doubles instead of integers to write functions. I was looking forward to this in the beginning of the semester. The contents in this lab were difficult when I started but looking back on it, I can tell that I have come a long way.

*Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because the lab consisted of using arguments which I was happy to use. I enjoyed this lab because I remember when I was writing it, it was the first time I got a hang of how arguments worked and turned vectors into strings which I was ecstatic for. I then used the arguments to print out ingredients into a sentence. I learned a lot that day and was starting to get a hang of programming.
