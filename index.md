### Favorite CPSC 120 L Labs

* Lab 1

  Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time I wrote code in C++. I was able to write “Hello Jerome!” and have it printed out in the terminal, which I had never done before. I took this as a huge learning opportunity and continued to seek out more knowledge about programming. The lab also benefited me since this is when I saw the benefits of pair programming.
  
* Lab 3

  Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it involved math for calculating the price of a pizza per square inch that was served. I liked this lab because it was the first lab that touched on using math in programming and using doubles instead of integers to write functions. I was looking forward to this at the beginning of the semester. The contents of this lab were difficult when I started, but looking back on it, I can tell that I have come a long way.

* Lab 4

  Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because the lab consisted of using if statements. I liked this lab because I learned how to use if statements and understood them quite quickly. This brought me reassurance since I was having trouble understanding them in the beginning, but through some trials and a little help from my partner, I began to learn how to use them properly. I will say that if statements helped me improve my coding abilities, and it was fun learning them.
